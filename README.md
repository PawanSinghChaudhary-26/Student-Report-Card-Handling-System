# Student-Report-Card-Handling-System
Student report card handling system is a simple console application built without the use of graphics in simple format.
In this project, users can perform typical report card related functions like adding a new student record and displaying, modifying, editing and deleting it.
This project is entirely based on C++ language.


NOTE :

1)  keep the [ student.dat ] and [ Project.exe ] files inside a single folder  for the code to work properly.

2)  [Project.cpp ] is the source code of the mini project.

3)  This code runs well with command prompt , code blocks IDE , VS code , Dev C++ etc.

4)  Password for edit menu is " aaaa".
